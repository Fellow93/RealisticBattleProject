	All avaliable strings taken from native strings. (for example; Enabled, Disabled, Default, Done, Cancel, etc...) So you don't need to translate them. 
      If you are using an officially supported language by Bannerlord, you don't need to translate those texts, they are all done. If you use unsupported language, then you need to translate game first. Translating the game will translate those strings for you too..

	for RBMCombat_ranged.xml Strings: Pound is a weight unit. 1 Pound = 0.453592 kg (kilograms). If you use kg as the weight unit, then you can look for values in Turkish or French translations.

	for RBMCombat_shields.xml Strings: Only "Shoulder Strapped" is added. Most of those shield names included in native strings. You can look for them and use same strings...
